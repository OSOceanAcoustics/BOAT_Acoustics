# Decibel


## What are we measuring?

* Start with an example of sound wave plot. What units is the data actually in?
* discussion of units



### Definition of Decibel
* Decibel is a relative measure of the ratio in power of two signals on a log-scale. Alternatively, one can think of it as the difference of log of the  

$10 \log(s_2/s_1)$

* read several signals and calculate the decibel with one referenced to the other one
* discuss general reference level


* Difference between decibel in air and ocean
	* air: human hearing
	* ocean:??

	
	20
	
	
	pressure *velocity constant
	
	signal voltage to pressure
	
	gain voltage
	
	
	power spectrum )if it is calibrated 
	
### Decibels in Air vs Water

While in air the reference level is the $20\mu Pa$ (the minimum level a human can hear), the reference in water is $\mu Pa$. Calculate what is the difference between dB in water and air.

$20\log_{10}(20) = 26 dB$ 

## What are we hearing?

* example of pretty plot with examples 

## What do animals hear?

* Point to how the range is high and the sounds of interest 




## Exercises

**Exercise 1:** Look at the table the decibel levels for breathing and trumpet. How much louder is the trumpet than the breathing?


breathing: 10 dB

trumpet: 110 dB

$100dB = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)$

The trumpet is 10^10 louder than the breathing.



**Exercise 2:**

  1. 1 person talking
  2. 10 people talking

What is the dB level of signal 2 with respect to signal 1.

$10\log_{10}(10)$


**Exercise 3:**
How much louder is the ferry vs ambient noise?



root mean square
average per second
